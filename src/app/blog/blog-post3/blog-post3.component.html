              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Site and if you have clicked on this blog post I am assuming you are here to read about my Journey and what lead me to where I am today.</p>
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold lg:text-5xl text-neutral-400">Background</h2>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">I honestly don't know where to begin, but I think I will give some more background about myself. I am currently in college at Clarkson University Studying to be a Software Engineer.
                I have been using tech and working with computers virtually my whole life. My first real excitment and exposure for and with tech, respectivly, was around the age of 8 or 9 when I started First Lego League Robotics.
                I had an amazing experience with this program, I had greate coaches and mentors as well as teammates and friends. Some of my fondest childhood memories are from this time.
              </p>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">I continued with robotics for about 5 years and stopped when I got to highschool. While also competing in Robotics I played a variety of sports like basketball, baseball, and cross-country.
                I wasn't very good at anything besides running so I continued doing other extracurriculers like CyberPatriot and taking my first real stabs at non-block based coding.
              </p>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">This was around when my love for computers began, I started learning some cool concepts with my peers and had fun doing it. I went through highschool doing both sports and extracurriculars like the ones mentioned above as well as others like Acadmeic Decathalon.</p>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">I then went to college and first declared as an Engineering and Management Undergraduate at Clarkson University.</p>
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold lg:text-5xl text-neutral-400">The Making of Me</h2>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Looking back at that time and that decision, I have some regret. One of the driving factors in the decision was my low self-esteem.
                I did not believe in my ability to complete upper level Math and Science courses but to be honest I didn't even give myself a chance. Due to some poor choices and outlooks on my position at the time I performed very poorly my first year of college.
                Becoming Academically Seperated and having to decide what I was going to do with my Life or what I would do after having this idea of what it would look like since I started Robotics at 8, was hard to reconcile with.
              </p>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">I was the first class to go to School with Covid in 2020 so that probably didn't help but due to this the school gave me a second chance. I decided to go with general engineering until I could make decision
                on my Major. I started to talk to professors as well as students and came across Software Engineering. I had been hearing so much about it with the Covid boom within the space and thought I would give it a shot.
                I took a few summer courses that introduced me to C++ and some basic programming concepts but I knew from then on where I was gonna be going.
              </p>

              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Since then I have made some amazing strides to really pursue a life of work I will enjoy and inspire others with. This decision has left me feeling like I'm a kid doing Robotics again.
                I have made at the minimum deans list for the last 2 and a half years and successfully secured a programming internship in the field I want to work in. I have had amazing support while on this journing and I know I wouldn't be here without many of my friends and family.
